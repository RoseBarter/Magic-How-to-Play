    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Mulligan</h4></li>
        <p>A mulligan is an optional process by which any player may attempt to draw a better opening hand before starting the game. The system of mulligan depends on the people you play with, so you should ask the other players at your table how they'd like to mulligan.</p>
      <li><h4>Mana</h4><!--Color--></li>
        <p>Mana is a renewable resource in Magic: The Gathering. Mana is generated by some cards, most notably land, and then used to play most of the game's cards and abilities. Mana is broken down into 5 primary types:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>White Mana, primarily generated by plains, and represented by a yellowish circle with a graphic of a sun in the center.</li>
            <li>Blue Mana, primarily generated by islands, and represented by a blue circle with a graphic of a waterdrop in the center.</li>
            <li>Black Mana, primarily generated by swamps, and represented by a grey circle with a graphic of a skull in the center.</li>
            <li>Red Mana, primarily generated by mountains, and represented by a red circle with a graphic of fire in the center.</li>
            <li>Green Mana, primarily generated by forests, and represented by a green circle with a graphic of a tree in the center.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Colorless appears too, and is actually the most common type of mana needed to pay costs, and it can be paid for with any color of mana. It appears in the costs of spells and abilities as a grey circle with a number in the center. The number dictates the amount of mana you need to spend.</p>
      <li><h4>Spell</h4></li>
        <p>Spells are all cards in Magic excluding lands.</p>
      <li><h4>Permanent</h4></li>
        <p>A permanent is any card that remains on the battlefield after it has been played.
      <li><h4>Cast/Play</h4></li>
        <p>Casting and playing a card are very similar concepts, though there are certain differences. When a card says you may "play a card" that means you can play lands too, but if a card says you can "cast a card" that means only spells can be played. Certain cards reference when you cast a certain kind of spell, and those effects will trigger as you cast the spell, but before the spell resolves.</p>
      <li><h4>Converted Mana Cost</h4></li>
        <p>The converted mana cost is how much a spell or ability costs. It is shown in the top right corner of spells, and is shown before the colon. If a spell has one red mana and two colorless mana in the mana cost, then the converted mana cost is three. Noteably no responces can be made to the paying of a cost of any kind.</p>
      <li><h4>"X"</h4></li>
        <p>"X" is a value that can appear in different locations on a Magic card. If "X" appears in the mana cost of a card, it is determined by how much you want to spend on "X". If "X" appears in the text of a card, the card will tell you how to determine the value of "X", often it will directly relate to the number of a certain type of card you control.</p>
      <li><h4>Additional Cost</h4></li>
        <p>Certain cards may promt you to pay an additional cost for a card. Often that will mean that you cannot play the card without paying that additional cost. However, there are a few additional costs that are optional, and those will give you an added benefit if you pay that cost.</p>
      <li><h4>Tap</h4></li>
        <p>Tapping is a way to pay for certain costs. It is shown on cards as a grey circle with the graphic of a rounded arrow pointing right. You represent that action of tapping by turning the card sideways. It appears most commonly in the cost of activated abilities. A tapped creature cannot block in combat.</p>
      <li><h4>Sacrifice</h4></li>
        <p>When a card asks you to sacrifice a type of permanent, you pick a permanent of the needed type (choosing the permanent does not need you to target it) and you send that permanent to the graveyard. Noteably, if the sacrificed permanent is a creature and that creature is blocking an attacking creature, the attacking creature will remain blocked, think of this like the attacker became distracted by the sacrificed creature, and therefor won't deal damage, unless the attacking creature has trample, in which case it will deal damage regardless.</p>
      <li><h4>Battlefield</h4></li>
        <p>The battlefield is where cards are "in play". It is where permanents go after they have resolved. It is where permanents need to be to have an effect.</p>
      <li><h4>Graveyard</h4><!--Destroy, Dies--></li>
        <p>The graveyard is the discard pile of this game. It is where creatures go when they "die". It is where permanents go after they are "destroyed".</p>
      <li><h4>Library</h4></li>
        <p>The library is your deck. It is where you draw cards from.</p>
      <li><h4>Exile</h4></li>
        <p>Exile is like your graveyard, but fewer cards interact with exile, meaning sending something to exile means they probably won't ever come back.</p>
      <li><h4>The Stack</h4></li>
        <p>The stack is a unique area in the game where spells go as you're casting them, and abilities go to resolve. Anytime any action enters the stack, priority passes around the table clockwise. Actions on the stack resolve as "last in, first out", meaning if you cast a spell and in responce to that another player cast an instant, the instant will resolve before the spell you cast.</p>
      <li><h4>Priority</h4></li>
        <p>Priorty is what allows a player to take actions. The player who's turn it will always be the first to get priority, but whenever an action of any kind enters the stack, priority will be passed to the other players, allowing them to respond and take actions of their own.</p>
      <li><h4>Counter target spell</h4></li>
        <p>Effects that counter a spell will stop them before they are able to resolve. For example, if you go to cast a spell and an opponent cast a counterspell, then the spell you cast will just go to the graveyard without doing anything.</p>
      <li><h4>Summoning Sickness</h4></li>
        <p>Summoning sickness is an effect that applies to all creatures. The first turn a creature is on the battlefield it will have summoning sickness, meaning it can't tap and cannot attack. I mean, you did just pull them though a magical portal from another dimention, so it makes sense that they'd need a moment to catch their breath.</p>
      <li><h4>Control/Own</h4></li>
        <p>To control a card is to have it on your side of the battlefield. To own a card means it started in your deck. This difference becomes relevant if someone steals a card from another player.</p>
      <li><h4>Target</h4><!--Each--></li>
        <p>Some cards may ask you to declare a target.To declare a target, you simply pick whick card you'd like the ability to <em>target</em>. The target must be declared as soon as the ability or spell enters the stack. Most targets are restricted to a certain card type, so make sure your declared target is legal within that restriction.</p>
      <li><h4>Activated Ability</h4></li>
        <p>An activated ability is a type of ability on a permanent card. It will come with a cost you need to pay, and that cost will be detailed before the effect, with a colon seperating the cost and effect. ([cost]:[effect]). You may activate an activated ability at any time, it is not restriced to your main phase.</p>
      <li><h4>Triggered Ability</h4></li>
        <p>A triggered ability is an effect that takes place when a certain requirement is met, that requirement will be detailed by the card. Like, if a creature card states, "when [insert card's name here] attacks, draw a card" then you get to draw a card as the creature attacks.</p>
      <li><h4>Static Ability</h4></li>
        <p>A static ability is one that is always in effect, there are no costs to make this effect happen, and no requirements need to be met. For example a card that says, "creatures you control gain +1/+1" then your creatures are a little bit bigger, and there's never a time where that buff isn't being applied.</p>
      <li><h4>Replacement Effect</h4></li>
        <p>A replacement effect is one that states, if you would do one thing, do another instead. This can be an effect such as "If you would draw a card, draw two instead" meaning for every one card you would normally draw, you get to double the amount drawn.</p>
      <li><h4>+1/+1 Counter</h4></li>
        <p>A +1/+1 counter is something applied to a creature card to give it additional power and toughness.</p>
      <li><h4>Damage/Paying Life/Life Loss</h4></li>
        <p>Damage happens whenever a creature deals damage, or a card specifically "deals damage". Paying life is often a cost, used by some effect. Life loss is anytime a player losses life. (Paying life is not damage, damage is not paying life, but damage and paying life are both life loss).</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Card Types</h2>
      <p>In Magic, card types appear in the middle of cards on the banner directly bellow the picture on the card, this information helps detail what the card does and how it behaves. If there is a "*" next to the type name, those types of cards must be played only during your main phase when the stack is empty (A card that must be played like this is commonly refered to as having "sorcery speed")</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Land*</h4></li>
            <p>Land is the most type of card in Magic, land is what helps you make mana, and mana is what lets you cast spells.</p>
          <li><h4>Artifact*</h4><!--Equipment--></li>
            <p>Artifact is a type of card that sits on the battlefield and provides an effect to the battlefield, whether that be an activated ability, triggered ability, static ability, or replacement effect. Artifact also has a unique subtype called "equipment". Equipment sit on the battlefield and come with an equip cost, which after that cost is paid it will attach to a creature you control, at which point it will give the equipped creature a buff.</p>
          <li><h4>Enchantment*</h4><!--Aura--></li>
            <p>Enchantments are almost identical to artifacts, however static abilities are much more common on enchantments than the other types of abilities. Enchantments also have their own unique but common subtype called "Auras". Aura's are similar to equipment, but rather than an equip cost needing to be paid, auras enter the battle field attached to their target. If a creature with an aura ever leaves the battlefield, the aura will go to the graveyard.</p>
          <li><h4>Creature*</h4><!--Creature Type--></li>
            <p>Creatures are the primary members of your army, and provide the simplest way to defeat an opponent, going to combat and dealing damage to them. Creature cards have a few things unique about them. In the bottom right-hand corner of a creature card there are two numbers; the first number is the creatures power, this tells you how much damage the creature can deal; the second number is the creature's toughness, this tells you how much damage the creature can take before it will die and go to the graveyard. If a creature's toughness is ever 0 it will die. Creatures also have a unique subtype, this is the creature type of the card, for example "goblin", "zombie", "elf", "human", and "wizard" are all common creature types. This is mostly to help build the fiction of the game, however, there are certain effects that care about the creature's creature type.</p>
          <li><h4>Planeswalker*</h4></li>
            <p>Planeswalkers are interesting. The fiction of them is they are powerful socerers much like yourself and they've come to aid you in your fight. Planeswalkers enter the battlefield with a number of "loyalty counters" equal to the number in the bottom right hand corner of their card. The number of loyalty counters by using the abilities on the card, at which point the number of ability counters will go either up or down, depending on the number on the left of the ability. Planeswalkers can also be attacked as if they were another player at the table. You cannot attack a planeswalker you control. If a planeswalker would ever take damage, instead that many loyalty counters are removed from them, and if a planeswalker ever has 0 loyalty counters, they will go to the graveyard. Every planeswalker is legendary.</p>
          <li><h4>Sorcery*</h4></li>
            <p>Sorveries are cards that do an effect detailed on the card, then go to the graveyard. These effects do not often persist.</p>
          <li><h4>Instant</h4></li>
            <p>Instant is a unique card type. You are allowed instants at anytime, meaning you can play them anytime you get priortiy, whether it's your turn or not. Though you are allowed to play them at sorcery speed if you want to.</p>
          <li><h4>Legendary</h4></li>
            <p>Legendary is a type most commonly found on permanents, and it means that you cannot have more than one on the battlefield with the same name at once. If you ever do have more than one on the battlefield then you must choose one of them and sacrifice the rest.</p>
          <li><h4>Token</h4></li>
            <p>Tokens are cards which have been created by other cards. They will be labled as tokens when they are created, and if they ever leave the battlefield they will cease to exist. Creature tokens are still able to die, even if they cease to exist immeadiately after.</p>
        </ul>

    <h2>Common Keywords</h2>
      <p>Keywords are broken down into two catergories of its own:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>Creature Keywords</h3></li>
          <p>Creature keywords are mostly found on creature cards and give the creatures that have hem effects.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Flying/Reach</h4></li>
                <p>Prepare to take to the skies with flying, and get ready to strike down those pesky fliers by using reach. A creature with flying can only be blocked by a creature with flying or reach. Reach does nothing for a creature other than allow it to block a creature with flying.</p>
              <li><h4>Trample</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with trample is determined to reach its goal, it will always try its best to reach its goal. Whenever a creature with trample becomes blocked it will deal any excess to the player or planeswalker it is attacking. For example a 3/4 creature with trample attacks a player and is blocked by a 1/1 creature, the 2 damage left over will trample over and hit the player.</p>
              <li><h4>Vigilance</h4></li>
                <p>Vigilant creatures are always prepared, and won't leave you defenceles. Attacking with a creature that has vigilance will not make it tap, whick can allow you to block later.</p>
              <li><h4>Menace</h4></li>
                <p>Creatures with menace are scary, and a creature will need a fellow ally in order to confront a menacing creature. Creatures with menace can only be blocked by two or more creatures. A single creature cannot block an attacking menace creature.</p>
              <li><h4>Hexproof</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with hexproof knows how to protect themselves. Creatures with hexproof cannot be targetted by spells or abilities that your opponents control.</p>
              <li><h4>Protection</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with protection specializes in protecting itself from a specific threat. Protection always comes with a quality it has protection from. The creature with protection can't be blocked, targeted, dealt damage, enchanted, or equipped by anything with the quality it has protection from.</p>
              <li><h4>Defender</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with defender is stuck in place, and is therefor unable to go on the offense. A creature with defender is unable to attack. This keyword is most commonly found on walls, and similar kinds of creatures.</p>
              <li><h4>Haste</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with haste can't wait to fight for you. A creature with haste is unaffected by summoning sickness, and therefor can tap and attack the turn it's played.</p>
              <li><h4>Deathtouch</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with deathtouch is extemely deadly. Creatures with deathtouch kill any other creature they damage, even just one point of damage from a creature with deathtouch can kill anything. If the creature has both deathtouch and trample, they will only need to deal one damage to its blocker and the rest will trample through.</p>
              <li><h4>Indestructible</h4></li>
                <p>A creature with indestructible cannot be killed by any means. No matter how much damage they take, a creature with indestructible will not die. Destroy effects do nothing to them. However if the creature gets its toughness brought down to zero, it will die, and exile effects still work against them.</p>
              <li><h4>First Strike/Double Strike</h4></li>
                <p>First strike/Double strike creatures are the true masters of combat. A creature with first strike deals damage before creatures without first strike during combat. Double strike is the older sibling of first strike, allowing the creature to deal damage both before and at the normal time damage is dealt.</p>
              <li><h4>Flash</h4></li>
                <p>Cards with flash are tricksters. Flash allows cards that would normally be bound to being cast at sorcery speed, to be played at instant speed.</p>
              <li><h4>Lifelink</h4></li>
                <p>Creatures with lifelink drain the life from those who they damage. When a creature with lifelink deals damage, the controller of the creature gains life equal to the amount of damage dealt.</p>
            </ul>
        <li><h3>Noncreature Keywords</h3></li>
          <p>Noncreature keywords can be found on creatures, but are not exclusive tho them, and they don't usually have a direct impact on the creature itself, but rather the game at large.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Mill</h4></li>
                <p>The word mill will always be acompanied by a number. When a card asks you to mill, you take that many cards from the top of your library and put them in your graveyard.</p>
              <li><h4>Scry</h4></li>
                <p>The word scry is always accompanied by a number. When a card tells you to scry, you get to look in the future, by looking at a number of cards on the top of your deck, equal to the number next to the word scry.</p>
            </ul>
      </ol>
    <p>Keep in mind that there are many more keywords that exist, I only wanted to explain the common ones.</p>
